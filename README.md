# LaTeX-Resources
My standard preamble and a style doc in the readme

package todonotes: used \todo{write a note} to insert to-do notes in margin
package nag: returns nagging error if a package or command I use is obsolete
package microtype: better font-adjustment to keep in the margins, etc

use \mathclap, \mathllap, \mathrlap to make TeX ignore a term (like a subscript) when determining spacing

Use \text instead of \mathrm
Use \int\displaylimits_a^b to put bounds above not next to

For \norm, if you want a subscript use e.g. \norm[2]{u} for the L^2 norm of u, or \norm
